To make use of this module you will need an API token from the University
of Melbourne Events website and a copy of the EventsAPI library.

You can download the library from github. It is available at:

  https://github.com/cafuego/uom_events_api

Create a directory called EventsAPI in sites/all/libraries and put the
EventsAPI.php file inside it.

You can check the Drupal Status report at admin/reports/status to ensure
the library is detected correctly.
